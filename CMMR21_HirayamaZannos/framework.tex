\begin{abstract}
This paper discusses composing works for interactive live performance
based on the comparison between recent artworks and experimental work
methods of the two authors. We compare the different interaction design
strategies employed and discuss the factors which influenced the choice
of methods for motion tracking and their influence on body movements
when coupled with the generation of sound during the performance. We
consider the resulting artworks as hybrid artforms that combine aspects
of music composition, improvised sound performance, and stage
performance or dance. A high-level comparison of the technical and
practical aspects of said works is provided. It can be argued that the
new expressive potential and the wealth of possibilities to be explored
warrants further work in this direction, and that systematic comparison
of the interactive characteristics and expressive affordances of the
systems developed are useful in guiding further research in the
development of novel hybrid performance forms.
